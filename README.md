## ⏲️ How the Pomodoro Technique Works

- **25 min** work session
- **5 min** short break after each session
- **20 min** long break after every 4 work sessions
- Visual **checkmarks (✔)** for each completed work session

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automatic switching between work, short breaks, and long breaks
- ✅ Countdown timer with visual updates
- ✅ Reset functionality to stop and clear the session
- ✅ Track your focus progress using checkmarks
- ✅ Minimal and distraction-free UI
